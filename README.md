# jwst_mast_query

This repository contains software for querying MAST for JWST observations and products, displaying the tables, summarizing them, and downloading the selected products to a local directory.

For installation instructions and documentation, see [our page on Outerspace](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/JN/Downloading+NIRCam+images+with+jwst_mast_query). Note that this page requires you to log in, as this tool at the moment is intended only for
instrument team members.
